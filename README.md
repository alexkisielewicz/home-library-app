This is Home Library App created as Portfolio Project #3 (Python Essentials) for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net). <br>

Project purpose was to build a command-line python application that allows user to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

I chose to develop an application that can be used in real life. Home Library allows users to manage their personal book libraries. Application contains such functionalities as: viewing book database, adding/editing and removing books. User can display details of every database entry and also sort database in chosen order.
